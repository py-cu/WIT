Py-CU, Champaign-Urbana's Python User Group, will host its first experimental Women in Technology (WIT) Open House event on [Month] [day] from 1:00pm to 4:00pm in the basement of the Independent Media Center (The Makerspace) in Urbana ([full address]). 

This informal event is targeted at women in the professional and hobbyist STEM community as well as women who would like to explore this world for the first time in a supportive environment. It will consist of a schedule of mini talks, a panel of representatives from CU tech groups, and small group breakout sessions focussed on specific topics.
