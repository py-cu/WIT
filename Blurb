Py-CU, Champaign-Urbana's Python User Group, is hosting its first experimental Women in Technology (WIT) Open House event on May 31, 2014 from 1:00pm to 4:00pm at the Independent Media Center in Urbana (202 S. Broadway Avenue). 

This informal event is targeted at women in the professional and hobbyist STEM community as well as women who would like to explore this world for the first time in a supportive environment. It will consist of a schedule of mini talks, a panel of representatives from CU tech groups, and small group breakout sessions focussed on specific topics.
