Py-CU, a python users group in Champaign-Urbana, will host its first and experimental Women in Information Technology (WIT) Open House event on March 8 from 1:00pm to 4:00pm in the basement of the Independent Media Center at Makerspace Urbana. This informal event is targeted at women in the professional STEM community as well as women who would like to explore this world for the first time in a supportive environment. It will consist of a schedule of mini talks and a panel while representatives of CU tech groups and specific topic discussion tables meet with attendees in-between those scheduled events.

For questions or just more information Py-CU can be contacted on Meetup (http://www.meetup.com/Python-CU/), Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/115113665332255/), Twitter (@PythonCU), and its website (http://py-cu.org).
