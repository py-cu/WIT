Py-CU, Champaign-Urbana's Python User Group, would like to extend a formal invitation to you to be a panelist at our first and experimental Womenâ€™s IT and Computing Open House event on March 8 from 1:00pm to 4:00pm in the basement of the Independent Media Center at Makerspace Urbana. This informal event is targeted at women, from women in the professional STEM community to women who would like to explore this world for the first time in a supportive venue. It will consist of a schedule of mini talks and a panel while representatives of CU tech groups and specific topic discussion tables meet with attendees inbetween those scheduled events.

You are being asked because of your presence in the general CU tech community and the value you would bring to what we hope will be a diverse and informative group of speakers and panelists. As a speaker, we invite you to decide on your topic based on whatever you would talk about, given the chance, to women who have a general interest in your field. Each speaker will be given 10 to 15 minutes with five minutes of question and answer time. Even if you feel that this may not be enough time for your topic of choice, do keep in mind that you will be given the chance to continue to discuss questions and concerns with attendees during the rest of the open house. 

We hope you would be able to accept this invitation. However, if you are unable to accept this year, we hope to have future open houses.
